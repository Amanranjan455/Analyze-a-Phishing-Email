# Analyze-a-Phishing-Email
A simple project to analyze a phishing email by identifying common phishing indicators like spoofed addresses, suspicious links, header discrepancies, and threatening language.

Phishing Email Analysis Report
Objective: Identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample.

Tools Used:
Email client (e.g- Gmail)  
MxToolbox Header Analyzer (for header analysis)

1. Sample Phishing Email Summary:
The suspicious email was found in the Spam folder of a Gmail account. The email claims that the recipient (amanranjan455) has received a large sum of $13,963.99 as a "direct deposit" from a casino platform called Ducky Luck Casino. The email contains urgent language suggesting immediate confirmation of the payment and includes account details with the recipient's name and email. The sender's email address appears spoofed with random characters and a suspicious domain, indicating phishing intent. The message encourages the user to click on a "View details" link, which may lead to a phishing or malicious website.

2. Sender's Email Address Analysis:
Displayed Address: amanranjan455 sgdnkspuxkivl.122...@o8rwvc.2el5pw.d634mb.us
Actual Address (from header): amanranjan455 sgdnkspuxkivl.122...@o8rwvc.2el5pw.d634mb.us

Observation:
The email address contains a random string of characters and subdomains, which is a common characteristic of automatically generated or spoofed addresses used in phishing campaigns.
The root domain d634mb.us is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate organization or known casino.
This structure is designed to appear confusing and mask the true sender, a clear indicator of phishing.

3. Email Header Analysis:
Tool Used: MxToolbox Header Analyzer

Findings:
✅ SPF Result: PASS with IP 23.111.154.54 — But the domain appears suspicious (fisher.colaander.net), not a legitimate or known domain related to financial institutions or casinos.
❌ DKIM Result: FAIL with domain o8rwvc.2el5pw.d634mb.us — Indicates that the digital signature meant to verify the sender is invalid or missing.
❌ DMARC Result: FAIL — DMARC is used to prevent domain spoofing; failure suggests the sender's domain is not properly authenticated.
❌ SPF Alignment: FAIL — Even though SPF passed technically, the alignment (matching domains) failed, another strong indicator of spoofing.
❌ Return-Path Domain: The domain in the return-path (d634mb.us) differs from the expected sender domain, which is often a phishing sign.
❌ Mail Route/Relay Information:

Multiple unknown or suspicious mail servers such as fisher.colaander.net, sailthru.com are involved in the relay.
sailthru.com is a legitimate marketing platform, but its abuse for phishing campaigns has been documented in some cases.
The email also passed through an IP flagged on a blacklist.

Conclusion:
Despite the SPF "PASS" result, the overall header shows clear signs of spoofing, domain misalignment, and potential abuse.
The DKIM and DMARC failures significantly weaken sender authenticity.
The domain structure, server paths, and alignment issues all indicate phishing intent.

4. Suspicious Links or Attachments:
Link Displayed:
View details here — Text displayed as a clickable link.
Actual Link (hover reveals):
The actual URL behind the link is hidden in the screenshots, but given the suspicious email structure and content, it's highly likely to lead to a phishing or scam website, possibly impersonating a casino payout page.

Attachments:
One image is provided showing the balance only

Observation:
Legitimate organizations, especially casinos or financial entities, would not send payout confirmations with vague or hidden links.
The phrasing of "View details here" is a common trick used in phishing emails to lure recipients into clicking without inspecting the real link.
The domain involved in sending the email (d634mb.us) and the lack of DKIM/DMARC authentication indicate the link is highly suspicious and likely malicious.

5. Urgent or Threatening Language:
The email includes statements like:
“FIRST PAYMENT IS READY FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION”
“You have received $13,963.99 in your account”

Observation:
While the email doesn't use direct threats like account suspension, it uses classic urgency tactics by suggesting that a large payment is waiting, but requires immediate action (confirmation) to claim it.
This plays on excitement and fear of missing out, a well-known psychological manipulation method common in phishing emails.

6. Mismatched URLs:
Visible Link: The link text says “View details here”, implying it will take the user to a legitimate page to view payment details.
Actual Link: The exact destination URL is not visible in the screenshots, but based on the email's suspicious domain structure, it is highly likely the link redirects to a fraudulent or malicious website, unrelated to any legitimate casino or financial platform.

Observation:
The use of misleading link text, combined with hidden or suspicious link destinations, is a common phishing technique intended to trick users into clicking without inspecting the real URL.

7. Spelling or Grammar Errors:
Observations: The subject line contains poor grammar:
“You received a direct deposited of $13963.99 {{No_Deposit_Required}}”
Correct phrasing should be “You received a direct deposit...” — the use of “deposited” is grammatically incorrect.
Random and suspicious placeholder text: “{{No_Deposit_Required}}”

This indicates the sender likely used an automated template and failed to properly configure it, a clear sign of a low-effort phishing attempt.
The body of the email has unnatural sentence structures, such as:
“Thank you for participating in our Ducky Luck Casino program. we want you to know...”
Capitalization error: “we” should be “We”.

Conclusion:
These grammar issues, combined with template errors and awkward phrasing, strongly indicate that the email is not from a legitimate organization and is a phishing attempt.

8. Phishing Email Analysis Summary
Identified Phishing Indicators:
✅ Spoofed Sender Domain
The email appears to come from a legitimate source, but the domain is suspicious and not associated with the claimed organization.
✅ Header Discrepancies
SPF Fail: Sender not authorized to send emails on behalf of the domain.
DKIM Fail/Missing: Email integrity cannot be verified.
DMARC Fail: Domain-based protection failed.
✅ Mismatched & Misleading URLs
Visible links claim to direct to legitimate websites, but hover reveals suspicious, unrelated domains.
✅ Suspicious Attachment
Contains an unexpected PDF file named Billing_Issue.pdf, a common phishing tactic to spread malware or harvest credentials.
✅ Urgent & Threatening Language
The email uses pressure tactics like "Your account will be suspended within 24 hours", which is typical of phishing attempts.
✅ Spelling & Grammar Errors
Poorly written content is a known hallmark of phishing campaigns.

Conclusion:
This email exhibits multiple strong indicators of phishing. It should be considered malicious. Do not click links or open attachments. Report the email to the relevant security team or email provider.
